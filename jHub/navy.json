        "main_body": "Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has accused the US of giving a Hollywood version of events over an incident in the Gulf this week.The US said Iranian vessels had conducted harassing approaches of six of its ships on Wednesday.But the IRGC said it had increased patrols in the Gulf after the US Navy blocked the path of an Iranian ship earlier this month.Tensions rose after the US killed an Iranian general in Iraq in January.The IRGC's statement said that US forces had blocked one of its ships in two separate incidents in early April, using dangerous behaviour while ignoring warnings.It added that Iran would respond decisively to any miscalculation.The incident on Wednesday came a day after armed men - believed to have been IRGC personnel - seized a Hong Kong-flagged tanker in the Gulf of Oman and redirected it into Iranian waters before releasing it.The US Navy accused Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) of dangerous and provocative actions against its vessels, which were involved in a military exercise with US Army Apache attack helicopters in international waters.  Eleven IRGC Navy vessels repeatedly approached of six US Navy and Coast Guard ships at extremely close range and high speeds on Wednesday, the US Navy said. One passed within 10 yards (9m) of a Coast Guard cutter.The US crews issued multiple warnings via bridge-to-bridge radio, five short blasts from the ships' horns and long-range acoustic noise maker devices, but received no response from the IRGCN.After approximately one hour, the IRGCN vessels responded to the bridge-to-bridge radio queries, then manoeuvred away from the US ships and opened distance between them, it added.The US Navy said such dangerous and provocative actions increased the risk of miscalculation and collision, and were not in accordance with international maritime conventions or customs. The relationship between the two countries has been fraught for decades. But tensions increased after the US withdrew from a nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.Last year, Iranian forces seized a British-flagged tanker in retaliation for the seizure of an Iranian tanker by the British territory of Gibraltar. Both vessels were eventually released.The US also accused Iran of carrying out attacks on six tankers in the Gulf of Oman and launching missiles and drones at two oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Iran denied any involvement.Animosity between the two countries rose further in January, when the US killed a top IRGC general in a drone strike in Iraq. Iran responded by launching missiles at Iraqi military bases hosting US forces. Boris Johnson will lead the Downing Street briefing later for the first time since his return to work."

        "date": "18 April 2020",
        "main_body": "Indian defence officials have reported a coronavirus outbreak at a key naval base in the western city of Mumbai.Twenty-one personnel have tested positive for Covid-19 at INS Angre, which is the seat of the force's western command, the navy said in a statement on Saturday. It added that there are no infections aboard any ships or submarines.India has 11,906 active infections and 480 deaths, according to the latest data from the ministry of health.The Navy said that they had tested a number of personnel who had come into contact with a soldier who had tested positive earlier this month. Many of those who had tested positive for the virus, the statement added, were asymptomatic. All 21 personnel live in the same residential block, which has been declared a containment zone and has been placed under lockdown. In a video message to personnel last week, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh stressed the importance of keeping ships and submarines free of the virus. The coronavirus pandemic is unprecedented and it has never been seen before. Its impact has been extraordinary across the globe, including India, he said.The navy has been playing an active role in India's response to the Covid-19 outbreak.It has set up isolation facilities to treat patients at one of its premier hospital units and is also running quarantine camps. The outbreak aboard the Indian naval base follows reports of outbreaks aboard vessels belonging to other nations. More than 500 sailors on the USS Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus and one of them died earlier this week. And nearly a third of the sailors serving with France's aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle - 668 out of nearly 2,000 - have been infected with coronavirus.Boris Johnson will lead the Downing Street briefing later for the first time since his return to work."
