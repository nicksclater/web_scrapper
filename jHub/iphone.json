        "main_body": "A flaw in Apple's mobile operating system may have left millions of iPhone and iPad users vulnerable to hackers.Research published by ZecOps, a mobile security firm, said a bug in the Mail app made devices susceptible to sophisticated attacks. The firm said it had high confidence the bug has been used to exploited at least six high-profile victims.An Apple spokesperson told Reuters a fix would be included in upcoming software updates.  In a statement, Apple said: We have thoroughly investigated the researcher's report and, based on the information provided, have concluded these issues do not pose an immediate risk to our users. The researcher identified three issues in Mail, but alone they are insufficient to bypass iPhone and iPad security protections, and we have found no evidence they were used against customers.ZecOps reported the bug to Apple in March. The tech giant had not previously known about the issue.To exploit this flaw, hackers would send a seemingly blank message to an iPhone or iPad users Mail account - the email app on iOS devices. When the email was opened it would crash the app forcing the user to reboot. During the reboot, hackers would be able to access information on the device.What makes this attack different from other hacks is users do not need to download any external software or visit a website that contains malicious software (malware). Typically hacks require some action on the part of the victim - those steps make possible to trace the origin of the attack.The researchers said the bug could be exploited even on recent versions of iOS.ZecOps claimed it had found evidence that the bug was used to attack well-known targets including individuals from a Fortune 500 company in North America, an executive from a mobile carrier in Japan, employees of technology companies in Saudi Arabia and Israel, a European journalist and an individual in Germany. The firm would not disclose the identities of the victims.  Apple products are typically considered to be more secure than other mobile devices. Experts say this shows how difficult it can be to spot underlying vulnerabilities.The company said: These potential issues will be addressed in a software update soon. We value our collaboration with security researchers to help keep our users safe and will be crediting the researcher for their assistanceBoris Johnson will lead the Downing Street briefing later for the first time since his return to work."

        "title": "Apple announces new iPhone SE to target mid-range market",
        "date": "15 April 2020",
        "main_body": "Apple has announced a new iPhone SE, reviving a mid-market brand it had discontinued in 2018.It resembles the form of 2017's iPhone 8 with a 4.7in screen, and a fingerprint ID sensor but not a depth camera for facial recognition.It is powered by the same processor as the flagship iPhone 11 Pro, but lacks multiple rear cameras.The handset costs the same as the original SE in the US, but is more expensive in other markets.The iPhone SE is priced at $399 in the US and \u00a3419 in the UK.One analyst said that having a mid-range phone again could help Apple compete for new customers against rivals such as Samsung and Google, which have a strong presence in that market sector.Once you buy an iPhone you are more likely to buy another one, said Dan Iver from Wedbush Securities. Despite Covid-19 causing lower demand, smartphone makers continue to release models. Earlier this week, OnePlus unveiled new models, and last month Huawei launched its flagship P40 range.In February, Apple warned that the coronavirus lockdown in China would impact iPhone production and lower sales.Physical stores, including Apple's, remain closed in many countries.But Mr Iver expects the phone to sell between 20 million and 25 million units in the first six to nine months. Apple's hands are almost being forced to bring this out because from a supply chain perspective it was ready, he said.But he added that while competitors might be similarly priced, Apple is this golden brand.The device supports wireless charging. Its rear-facing camera's resolution is 12 megapixels and can still create background blur in portrait photos, despite lacking a second lens. The selfie camera is 7MP.Mobile analyst Carolina Milanesi also said Apple's brand appeal would help it in this price range.The second-hand market is pretty vibrant for Apple so are there users who have never have a new iPhone that will want one, and can afford it at this price, said the Creative Strategies consultant.But she also warned: I think the phone has to have some compromises. It can't be too close to the iPhone 11 or a iPhone XR - or what is the point? Boris Johnson will lead the Downing Street briefing later for the first time since his return to work."
